Stack Overflow App is a desktop client for [stackoverflow.com]() with fancy design and reactive UI build on [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron). I love answer questions and help community, but I don't really like the overloaded UI of the original website, also I would like to introduce new and useful features.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** This App is under development. See the development process here [livecoding.tv/max_diachenko](https://www.livecoding.tv/max_diachenko/). It's an absolutely hobby project so no deadlines, no commercial.

Visit [stackoverflowapp.com]() for more details (TDB).

Follow [@me](twitter.com/max_diachenko) on Twitter for important announcements and launch date. Use hashtag [#stackoverflowapp](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23stackoverflowapp&src=typd) to spread news

## Features (Why?)

- Faster ([learn why]() – TBD)
- Better editor (tabs are working now 😉)
- Prettier design
- Native notifications of rep changing, new inbox and achievemts etc.
- Improved userflow for answerers
- Pinned questions (not favorite)
- Likes instead of Upvotes and Downvotes (world peace ✌️)
- Better comments flow
- Creating JSFiddle right on the question screen
- ...more
